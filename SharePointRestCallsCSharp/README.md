# SharePoint
In this sample, I have demonstrated how to invoke SharePoint REST calls from client side. Here, I have used a C# Console Application to fetch the following:
* the given Web's` property
* selected List's property
* ListItems (only 1 using $top)

I have also blogged about getting the ListItems which you can find [here] (https://realmpksharepoint.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/sharepoint-rest-api-c/).

### Input
In order to run this application, you need to update the site url and credential properties.

### Output
Output will be dumped in 3 separate files inside the bin->Debug folder. The output files are:
* Web
* List
* ListItems
